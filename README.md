# Rhythm Record Recorder

## Overview
This is a simple way of recording scores in the various rhythm games I play.

## How to use
To use first clone this repo, and then run ```json-server --watch db.json``` to access the database of records. Then run ```npm start``` to start the react applicaiton. 

Once started, submit scores by clicking "Record Scores" tab. Be sure to select the correct game when inputting your score. But if you make a mistake, you can always remove it later, just go to the page of the game and select the checkbox that says 'remove scores'.
