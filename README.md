# Rhythm Record Recorder

## Description
For my phase 2 project, I decided to make a simple way of recording records of the various rhythm games I play.

## How to use
To use first clone this repo, and then run ```json-server --watch db.json``` to access the database of records. Then run ```npm start``` to start the react applicaiton. 

Once started, submit scores by clicking "Record Scores" tab. Be sure to select the correct game when inputting your score. But if you make a mistake, you can always remove it later, just go to the page of the game and select the checkbox that says 'remove scores'.  

## Special Thanks
Thank you youtube tutorials for showing me how to create the nifty side nav-bar.
